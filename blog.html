<h2>I had a lot of trouble getting this assignment done, and I'm a complete stranger to HTML, including Github. So the first
assignment took me by surprise when I started writing HTML files. I collected a lot of information on the Internet,
including setting up my own Github and creating new keys to connect to the school server.
From this assignment, I learned how to build a basic website using HTMl files. I've learned that Github is the way to
connect local files to a network or school server.
I would say Google is the biggest helper, and I'm constantly searching and trying to figure out how to master these
features.</h2>
