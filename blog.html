<h3>
    * What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those
    problems?

</h3>
<p>
    This is a big challenge for me. I don't have a thorough understanding of CSS. I don't know what size of text I should
    use, what length and width of scale, and I don't know how to use those CSS properties. I solved these problems by doing
    a lot of searching on Google and watching a lot of youtube videos.

<h3>
    * What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already
    knew?

</h3>
<p>
    I learned a lot of basic CSS knowledge from my homework and was able to make some changes to a web page, which I thought
    was pretty cool. There is no special opinion. I found that I already knew about the use of various selectors.

<h3>
    * What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza
    forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?

</h3>
<p>
    The ones that helped me the most were the bloggers on youtube, because they were very careful with all the details,
    which helped me a lot, because the CSS theory we learned in class was too general. The link is www.youtube.com
    :)

<h3>
    * What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?

</h3>
<p>
    I had to Google those specific CSS terms and properties such as fles-basis.
